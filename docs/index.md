# Welcome to Hibby's Packet Radio Guide

Hi, welcome - thanks for coming by!

## What is Packet Radio?

Packet Radio is a niche within [Amateur Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio). It combines elements of networking and the dark art of software to connect computers over a long distance without wires.

With packet radio we can transfer information, files or messages without relying on the internet. We can control and understand every part of our link, from the computer and the software, through the modem, radio and antenna.

## Taking Your First Steps

This is a broad part of our hobby, and it can be overwhelming to get started. There are lots of interconnecting components and new terms to learn.

Keep your eye on the [glossary](glossary.md) if the terms get confusing.

The key things you will need are:

  * An Amateur Radio License
  * A radio
  * An antenna
  * A computer
  * A modem
  * A cable to interface between the computer & radio
  * Software

### Recommended first setup

A tried and true first setup is to use a [proven radio](radios/index.md) with [QtSoundModem](modems/qtsm.md) and [QtTermTCP](clients/qtttcp.md) on VHF or UHF at 1200bd to access someone else's node.
